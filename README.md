# Leemur's Estonian Deck
GitHub mirror and backup of my Estonian vocab deck available on [AnkiWeb](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/540341841) with the raw card files in the event that it's ever unavailable on AnkiWeb.

My personal deck of over 20,000 cards for Estonian vocabulary. The deck includes key case declensions/conjugations and sample sentences for all cards.
